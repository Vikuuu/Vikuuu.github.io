# Introduction

When containerizing a Django project using Docker, it's common to pair it with a PostgreSQL database. However, during my recent project, I encountered an issue that many developers might face: Django couldn't connect to PostgreSQL, despite having all the necessary libraries installed - or so I thought.

# The Problem

After adding **psycopg2** to my **requirements.txt**, I was surprised to find that Django was unable to connect to PostgreSQL. The error message was cryptic: *"Error loading psycopg2 or psycopg module."* This was particularly puzzling since everything seemed to be set up correctly.

# The Setup

- Python version: 3.12
- Base Docker image: Alpine 3.20

Alpine is known for its lightweight nature, which is excellent for reducing the size of Docker images. However, this also means that some essential libraries and dependencies are stripped out.

# Understanding the Issue
**psycopg2** is a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python. It's a C library that wraps around **libpq**, the PostgreSQL client library. For psycopg2 to compile and work correctly, it needs access to libpq header files, which aren't included in the minimal Alpine image.

# The Solution
To resolve this issue, I needed to modify me Dockerfile to include the necessary dependencies before installing **psycopg2**. Here's the updated section of my Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-alpine3.20

# Install build dependencies
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache \
        postgresql-dev \
        musl-dev \
        zlib  zlib-dev \
        libqp-dev

# Install Python dependencies.
COPY ./requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Other Dockerfile commands....
```

# Key Takeaways

1. **Lightweight Images come with Trade-offs**: Using lightweight images like Alpine is great, but you need to be aware of the missing dependencies that might be crucial for your project.

2. **Read the Documentation**: Always check the library documentation for dependencies ([for this problem](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites)), especially when compiling C extensions.

3. **Debugging Docker Issues**: Understanding the underlying cause of errors is crucial. In this case, knowing that psycopg2 relies on libpq led me to the solution.

# Conclusion
Docker is a powerful tool, but it requires careful attention to detail, especially when using minimal base images. By understanding the requirements of your libraries and ensuring your image includes all necessary dependencies, you can avoid issues like the one I encountered.

If you're using Django with PostgreSQL and Docker, keep this in mind and save yourself some headaches!
